# Terms and definitions
In the following section, extraordinary sun related terms and definitions, used in the package as variables or as return values, are explained.

## Elevation angle
An ["angle between the horizontal plane and oblique line from the observer’s eye to some object above his eye"](https://byjus.com/maths/angle-of-elevation/). In the context of the Physical Sunlight Simulator, the elevation angle is the angle of the arm to the table. As such, when the arm is in a resting position the elevation angle is 0 degrees and when it reaches its maximum height the elevation angle is 90 degrees (see *Figure 1*).

## Azimuth angle
The [compass direction from which the sunlight is coming](https://www.pveducation.org/pvcdrom/properties-of-sunlight/azimuth-angle). In the context of the Physical Sunlight Simulator, the azimuth angle is the angle the table is turned (see *Figure 1*).

## Sun declination
The angle earth's equator tilts (see *Figure 2*) with respect to the plane of earth's orbit around the sun throughout the year (see *Figure 3*).

## Meridian

*Figure 4: Description of the local meridian*

## Hour angle
The angular displacement of the sun east or west of the local meridian due to rotation of the earth on its axis (see *Figure 5*) at 15° per hour with morning being negative and afternoon being positive (see *Figure 6*).

## True solar time
[The apparent sun is the true sun as seen by an observer on Earth.[4] Apparent solar time or true solar time[a] is based on the apparent motion of the actual Sun.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_time).

## Mean solar time
![Mean solar time is the hour angle of the mean Sun plus 12 hours.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_time)

## Equation of time
The difference between apparent solar time and mean solar time.

## Geographical latitude
[In geography, latitude is a coordinate that specifies the north–south position of a point on the surface of the Earth. Latitude is given as an angle that ranges from −90° at the south pole to 90° at the north pole, with 0° at the Equator.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude)

## Standard time merdian longitude
[Standard time is the synchronization of clocks within a geographical region to a single time standard, rather than a local mean time standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_time) (see *Figure 7*).
